# My-College-Website-with-my-innovation
This college website project is built with HTML and CSS, providing a responsive, user-friendly interface to showcase the institution's courses, faculty, events, and admissions. The website features a clean, organized layout, with navigation for departments, an "About Us" section, and contact details. HTML structures the content, while CSS enhances the visual appeal, ensuring accessibility and a cohesive design for prospective students and faculty members.
